# NR > 1 first line (the header) is skipped
# $1 printing the chromosme name 
# "\t" separate the output by tabs, which is required for bed formatting 
# $2-1 subtract 1 from the seccond column (start psoition must be ending in a 0 as bed tool uses zero based indexing)#
# $3 print the third column (end position)

awk 'BEGIN {OFS="\t"} {if($3=="gene") {split($9, a, ";"); split(a[1], b, "="); print $1, $4-1, $5, b[2], ".", $7}}' C_excelsa_V5_braker2_wRseq.gff3 > genes.bed4

  #BEGIN {OFS="\t"} sets output feild separator to a tab. emsures that the output .bed is separated by tabs
  
  #{if($3=="gene") only rows with gene data will be processed

  #{split($9, a, ";") Any attrbutes in column 9 which are separated by a ; are split 

  #split(a[1], b, "=") split first attribute (separated by equals sign) into new array.
  ie ID=g267 is split into ID and g267

  #print $1, $4-1, $5, b[2], ".", $7}} this is the output 
$1 print the chromosome name 
$4-1 converts the start positon to a zero based format (needed for bed tools interpretation)
$5 is the end psoition column
b[2] is the gene ID (as seen above in format g.....ect)
"." score field used for bed 
$7 column which shows if the strand is positive or negative (5' -> 3' or 3' -> 5')
